"""
Provides the module with access to certain libraries that have more than one suitable implementation, in a optimally
degredating manner.

Provides - `etree` and `json`

`etree` can be from any of the following, if found in the local environment:
    `lxml`
    `xml.etree`
    `elementtree`
    `cElementTree`

`json` can be from any of the following:
    `json` (python >= 2.6)
    `simplejson`
    
If no suitable library is found, then it will pass back `None`
